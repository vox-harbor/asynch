## Introduction

`asynch` is an asynchronous ClickHouse Python driver with native TCP interface support, which reuses most of [clickhouse-driver](https://github.com/mymarilyn/clickhouse-driver) features and complies with [PEP249](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/).

## Installation

```shell
> pip install asynch
```

If you want to install [`clickhouse-cityhash`](https://pypi.org/project/clickhouse-cityhash/) to enable transport compression

```shell
> pip install asynch[compression]
```

## Release v0.3.0 announcement

The version 0.2.5 should have been named v0.3.0 due to compatibility-breaking changes.
Since the release v0.2.5 is already yanked (of sorts), a smooth upgrade seems inexpedient.

Before upgrading to the v0.3.0, please pay attention to the incompatible changes:

1. the `connect` function from the `async/connection.py` module is now asynchronous context manager.
2. the same kind of changes touches the `create_pool` function from the `async/pool.py` module.
3. all deprecated methods from `Connection`, `Cursor` and `Pool` classes are removed.

For more details, please refer to the project [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Usage

Basically, a connection to a ClickHouse server can be established in two ways:

1. with a DSN string, e.g., `clickhouse://[user:password]@host:port/database`;

    ```python
    from asynch import connect

    # connecting with a DSN string
    async def connect_database():
        async with connect(
            dsn = "clickhouse://ch_user:P@55w0rD:@127.0.0.1:9000/chdb",
        ) as conn:
            pass
    ```

    or

    ```python
    from asynch import Connection

    # connecting with a DSN string
    async def connect_database():
        conn = Connection(
            dsn = "clickhouse://ch_user:P@55w0rD:@127.0.0.1:9000/chdb",
        )
        async with conn:
            pass
    ```

2. with separately given connection/DSN parameters: `user` (optional), `password` (optional), `host`, `port`, `database`.

    ```python
    from asynch import connect

    # connecting with DSN parameters
    async def connect_database():
        async with connect(
            user = "ch_user",
            password = "P@55w0rD",
            host = "127.0.0.1",
            port = 9000,
            database = "chdb",
        ) as conn:
            pass
    ```

    or

    ```python
    from asynch import Connection

    # connecting with DSN parameters
    async def connect_database():
        async with Connection(
            user = "ch_user",
            password = "P@55w0rD",
            host = "127.0.0.1",
            port = 9000,
            database = "chdb",
        ) as conn:
            pass
    ```

If a DSN string is given, it takes priority over any specified connection parameter.

Create a database and a table by executing SQL statements via an instance of the `Cursor` class (here its child `DictCursor` class) acquired from an instance of the `Connection` class.

```python
async def create_table(conn: Connection):
    async with conn.cursor(cursor=DictCursor) as cursor:
        await cursor.execute("CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS test")
        await cursor.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE if not exists test.asynch
        (
            `id`       Int32,
            `decimal`  Decimal(10, 2),
            `date`     Date,
            `datetime` DateTime,
            `float`    Float32,
            `uuid`     UUID,
            `string`   String,
            `ipv4`     IPv4,
            `ipv6`     IPv6
        )
        ENGINE = MergeTree
        ORDER BY id
        """
        )
```

Fetching one row from an executed SQL statement:

```python
async def fetchone(conn: Connection):
    # by default, an instance of the `Cursor` class
    async with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        await cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
        ret = await cursor.fetchone()
        assert ret == (1,)
```

Fetching all the rows from an executed SQL statement:

```python
async def fetchall():
    async with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        await cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
        ret = await cursor.fetchall()
        assert ret == [(1,)]
```

Using an instance of the `DictCursor` class to get results as a sequence of `dict`ionaries representing the rows of an executed SQL query:

```python
async def dict_cursor():
    async with conn.cursor(cursor=DictCursor) as cursor:
        await cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
        ret = await cursor.fetchall()
        assert ret == [{"1": 1}]
```

Inserting data with `dict`s via a `DictCursor` instance:

```python
from asynch.cursors import DictCursor

async def insert_dict():
    async with conn.cursor(cursor=DictCursor) as cursor:
        ret = await cursor.execute(
            """INSERT INTO test.asynch(id,decimal,date,datetime,float,uuid,string,ipv4,ipv6) VALUES""",
            [
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "decimal": 1,
                    "date": "2020-08-08",
                    "datetime": "2020-08-08 00:00:00",
                    "float": 1,
                    "uuid": "59e182c4-545d-4f30-8b32-cefea2d0d5ba",
                    "string": "1",
                    "ipv4": "0.0.0.0",
                    "ipv6": "::",
                }
            ],
        )
        assert ret == 1
```

Inserting data with `tuple`s:

```python
async def insert_tuple():
    async with conn.cursor(cursor=DictCursor) as cursor:
        ret = await cursor.execute(
            """INSERT INTO test.asynch(id,decimal,date,datetime,float,uuid,string,ipv4,ipv6) VALUES""",
            [
                (
                    1,
                    1,
                    "2020-08-08",
                    "2020-08-08 00:00:00",
                    1,
                    "59e182c4-545d-4f30-8b32-cefea2d0d5ba",
                    "1",
                    "0.0.0.0",
                    "::",
                )
            ],
        )
        assert ret == 1
```

### Connection Pool

Before the v0.2.4:

```python
async def use_pool():
    pool = await asynch.create_pool()
    async with pool.acquire() as conn:
        async with conn.cursor() as cursor:
            await cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
            ret = await cursor.fetchone()
            assert ret == (1,)
    pool.close()
    await pool.wait_closed()
```

Since the v0.2.5:

```python
async def use_pool():
    # init a Pool and fill it with the `minsize` opened connections
    async with Pool(minsize=1, maxsize=2) as pool:
        # acquire a connection from the pool
        async with pool.connection() as conn:
            async with conn.cursor() as cursor:
                await cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
                ret = await cursor.fetchone()
                assert ret == (1,)
```

which decomposes into

```python
async def use_pool():
    pool = Pool(minsize=1, maxsize=2)
    await pool.startup()

    # some logic

    await pool.shutdown()
```

Since the v0.3.0 the `create_pool` is asynchronous context manager:

```python
from asynch.pool import create_pool

async def use_pool():
    async with create_pool(minsize=1, maxsize=2) as pool:
        # some logic
```
